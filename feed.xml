<p><strong>Because the Code of Points change after every Olympics Games, we study the 2017-2020 period in order to keep the data coherent.</strong></p>

<h2 id="a-word-about-gymnastics">A word about gymnastics</h2>

<p>There are 6 <strong>apparatus</strong> in Men Artistic Gymnastics (MAG): floor, pommel horse, still rings, vault, parallel bars, and high bar. The performance of a gymnast on an apparatus is called a <strong>routine</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>score</strong> of a routine is decomposed into two scores: the <strong>Execution score</strong> (E score) and the <strong>Difficulty score</strong> (D score). The D score is determined by the <strong>elements</strong> and <strong>combination of elements</strong> performed by a gymnast. The <strong>Difficulty Value</strong> of each element is written in the <strong>Code of Points</strong>, a code that is changed every four years after each Olympic Games. The <strong>Execution score</strong> of a routine is computed by subtracting from a total of 10 points, a prescribed number of points for each <em>error</em> that are spotted by the execution jury. Usually, 0.1 points are lost for small mistake, 0.3 for medium one and 0.5 for large error. One full point can be removed for a fall (or bumping into the apparatus). The <strong>Total score</strong> of a routine is the sum of the <strong>D score</strong> and <strong>E score</strong>.</p>

<p>There are seven events in a MAG competition: one for each apparatus and one called the all-around. In an <strong>all-around event</strong>, gymnasts execute a routine on each apparatus and are ranked by the sum of all apparatus’ scores.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-study">What do we study?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>For each event, we try to understand how the total score, total D-score, and total E-score can vary as a function of the rank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To do so, for each event, we plot:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the event total score as a function of the rank</li>
  <li>the D score as a function of the rank</li>
  <li>the E score as a function of the rank</li>
  <li>the E score as a function of the D score</li>
</ul>

<p>We plot the E score as a function of the D score to better illustrate the potential trade-off between E score and D score.</p>

<p><strong>In this post, we wonder how to compare performances of athletes across weight classes.</strong></p>

<p>We consider participants to the season 1 of the <strong><a href="https://www.kingofweighted-showdown.com/">King of Weighted Calisthenics</a></strong> competition, an international and internet based event organized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaSchulz">Micha Schulz</a>. <br />During this <strong>weighted calisthenics competition</strong>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>each participant had to <em>get their <strong>weighted</strong> equipment and record their 1RM<d-footnote>One-repetition maximum: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum</a></d-footnote> attempts for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_(exercise)">dips</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_(exercise)">pull-ups</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)">squats</a></strong> according to some specified rules</em> (especially regarding the range of motion).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the work done by the <a href="https://www.powerlifting.sport/">International Powerlifting Association</a>, we compute a formula similar to their <a href="https://www.powerlifting.sport/rules/codes/info/ipf-formula">IPF GL</a> that allows to rank all participating athletes according to a point system.</p>

<p>The <strong>total mass</strong> lifted by a participant is the sum of all its three lifts,</p>

\[\text{total lifted mass} = \text{dip} + \text{squat} + \text{pull-up},\]

<p>and it mainly increases with the weight class, i.e., the heavier the athletes, the heavier they can lift.<d-footnote>I would need a study/meta-analysis to back-up this claim. If you know a reliable one, please contact me and I will add a reference.</d-footnote> Therefore, the <strong>total lifted mass</strong> is not a good scoring system to compare performances of athletes with different body features as it favors heavier athletes without considering the <em>exerted effort relative to body features</em>. If the total strength of heavier athletes is systematically larger than the one of heavier athletes, then this say something about the physiology of human beings (as a group) but not about the <em>exerted effort</em> of individual athletes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <strong>the relative total lifted mass</strong>,</p>

\[\text{relative total lifted mass} = \frac{\text{dip} + \text{squat} + \text{pull-up}}{\text{bodyweight}},\]

<p>is said to systematically favor lighter athletes<d-footnote>I would need a study/meta-analysis to back-up this claim. If you know a reliable one, please contact me and I will add a reference.</d-footnote> and therefore is not a good scoring system. If the relative strength of lighter athletes is systematically larger than the one of heavier athletes, then this say something about the physiology of human beings (as a group) but not about the <em>exerted effort</em> of individual athletes.</p>

<p><strong>So, how do we compute a (as good as possible) point system?</strong></p>

<h2 id="computing-a-point-system">Computing a point system</h2>

<p>We use an approach that we deem similar to the IPF one. The number of points of an athlete will be of the form</p>

\[\text{points} = \frac{\text{total mass lifted}}{\text{predicted best lift} (\text{body features})},\]

<p>where <em>predicted best lift</em> is a function that, given an athlete’s body features, compute its expected best lift. This function should therefore be related to the maximal strength performance an athlete can produce, given its body features. The number of points is then the <em>ratio</em> between its actual lift and this prediction. If this ratio is smaller than one, the athletes <em>underperformed</em> compared to the prediction, while a ratio larger than one should indicate a strong athlete that outperform this prediction. If the quality of the prediction is good enough, then this <strong>point system</strong> is reasonable enough.</p>

<p>However, the question of the prediction function remains. We first try to answer the following question: <strong>given an athlete’s <em>body features</em>, what is the largest <em>reasonable total mass</em> the athlete could have lift?</strong></p>

<h2 id="computing-a-strength-prediction-function">Computing a strength prediction function</h2>

<h3 id="which-body-features">Which body features?</h3>

<p>The more body features we decide to use, the more complicated the formula might end up. We want to <strong>find measurable body features with a high predictive power</strong> for the performances of the best athletes with those features. <strong>A very simple hypothesis</strong> that is made by the IPF is that <strong>the best an athlete could have lift is a function of its bodyweight only</strong>. I will use this hypothesis in the remaining of this post. However, I do think that the height of an athlete is an important feature as well, as it is related to the length of most of the limbs. On the other hand, for high level powerlifting competition, such as the one organized by the IPF, athletes of similar height tends to have a similar physical build as opposed to what can be observed in the general population. In theory, one could try use the body composition measured and computed by a DEXA scan.<d-footnote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition#DEXA">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_composition#DEXA</a></d-footnote> However, finding a good formula is hard enough with the bodyweight only, and adding all those features won’t really simplify the task. One way around that would be to use neural network,<d-footnote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network</a></d-footnote> but this is a topic for another post!</p>

<p><strong><em>Remark:</em></strong> Unfortunately, while it is quite an important body feature on its own, one could only compute a formula for male participants. There were not enough female participants at the king of weighted competition to compute any relevant formula. The reasoning is independent of the sex, but the specific computed number later are expected to be different depending on the sex.</p>

<p>We therefore aim to find a function <em>predicted best lift</em> such that,</p>

\[\text{largest reasonable total lifted mass} = \text{predicted best lift} (\text{bodyweight}) .\]

<h3 id="which-function">Which function?</h3>

<p>How do we find such a function?</p>

<p>Our model state that the strength of athletes increases with the bodyweight, hence the <em>predicted best lift</em> function should be <strong>strictly monotonic increasing</strong>.<d-footnote><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monotonic_increasing">https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monotonic_increasing</a></d-footnote> Our model also state that the strength of athletes obeys a law of diminishing return,<d-footnote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns</a></d-footnote> <em>i.e.</em>, the relative strength decreases, hence the <em>predicted best lift</em> function should be <strong>concave</strong>.<d-footnote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_function">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_function</a></d-footnote> While we decided upon some necessary properties of our model, those are far from sufficient to pick a function. As far as I wanted to derive a formula based on necessary and sufficient properties<d-footnote>If you are a sport scientist interested in this topic and want to try a few ideas, please reach me out!</d-footnote>, I am not a sport scientist and I will have to rely on existing formulas.</p>

<p>The IPF suggest the following function,</p>

\[a - b \exp ( -c \times \text{bodyweight}),\]

<p>where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive coefficients, and $\exp$ is the exponential function.<d-footnote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function</a></d-footnote>  As far as I am concerned, my first guess would have been to try something like</p>

\[a + b \times \text{bodyweight} + c \ln (\text{bodyweight} + d),\]

<p>where $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are coefficients, and $\ln$ is the logarithm function.<d-footnote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm</a></d-footnote>  However, I am not a sport scientist so we will use the formula suggested by the IPF.</p>

<h3 id="which-coefficients">Which coefficients?</h3>

<p>To find the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the proposed formula, we will rely on the data from the king of weighted competition. The aim of the formula is to compute a reasonable <strong>best performance</strong>. Therefore, we first compute the considered <strong>top-20%</strong> athletes and then use those performances to compute the values of the coefficients.</p>

<p>By only using the subset of athletes that are <strong>top-performer</strong>, we ensure that our function will effectively <strong>compute</strong> an approximation of the <strong>expected best lift</strong> of an athlete given its bodyweight. The threshold must be high enough so that we only consider top-performer. However, it should be low enough that we have enough data, represents of almost all bodyweight and that we consider more than the absolute best. Considering only the absolute best would be a mistake as it could diminish the number of points a participants of similar weight would receive because a once-in-a-century athletes has similar features. Hence, the expression <em>reasonable best</em> lift that we used.</p>

<p>To compute the coefficients, we use a technique called regression analysis,<d-footnote><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis</a></d-footnote> where we try to find the coefficients that fit the data the best. Let’s do that and see how it looks!</p>

<p>In the following graph, the <strong>color of the points</strong> is related to the <strong>number of points</strong>: the bluer, the smaller the number of points, the redder, the higher the number of points. The <strong>size and transparency of the points</strong> are also related to the number of points: the bigger and darker, the larger the number of points.</p>

<p>The plotted curve does seem like the graph of a descent <em>largest reasonable total lifted mass</em> function. The attributed number of points also does seem to be coherent with the point system we wished to build.</p>

<p><strong>In this post, we use New Year as a pretext to write down formulas that computes expected competitive performances based on a calisthenics practitioner bodyweight. Hopefully, those expected lifts can be used to set goals for this year and the next to come!</strong></p>

<p><em>Caveat:</em> While we intend to help calisthenics practitioners train in an efficient and effective way by making available some useful numbers, <strong>data analysis comes with a good share of caution</strong>.</p>

<p>First, the context: data from which the analysis is built upon come from a weighted calisthenics competition. Second, for all computed average values, the reader must always keep in mind that some <strong>standard deviation</strong><d-footnote>Standard deviation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation</a></d-footnote> <strong>around the mean is expected</strong>. Predictions computed from the data, could be used as a first approximation of a target while keeping in mind your unique body features.</p>

<p><strong>Shall we not be deluded by sheer and raw numbers, we can certainly make good use of them!</strong></p>

<p>In the <a href="/blog/2022/king-weighted-calisthenics/">previous post</a>, the data showed that <strong>I am roughly halfway from being average ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</strong>.</p>

<p>My weighted calisthenics goal is to become an average balanced participant. I present my target lifts at the end of the post, after revealing the formulas.</p>

<h2 id="weighted-calisthenics">Weighted calisthenics</h2>

<p>In 2022 was held the season 1 of the <strong><a href="https://www.kingofweighted-showdown.com/">King of Weighted Calisthenics</a></strong> competition, an international and internet based event organized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaSchulz">Micha Schulz</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each participant had to <em>get their <strong>weighted</strong> equipment and record their 1RM<d-footnote>One-repetition maximum: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum</a></d-footnote> attempts for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_(exercise)">dips</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_(exercise)">pull-ups</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)">squats</a></strong> according to some specified rules</em> (especially regarding the range of motion).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <strong>weighted calisthenics</strong>, one has to lift the additional weight that is attached to one’s body.</p>

<p><strong>Were you a competitive lifter, how much can you expect to lift?</strong></p>

<h2 id="set-a-goal-for-2023">Set a goal for 2023!</h2>

<p>From the data, we compute several formulas, all of the form,</p>

\[goal = a \times bodyweight + b ,\]

<p>where your <strong>goal</strong> will be computed using your <strong>bodyweight</strong> thanks to two coefficients, <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>.
Formulas will be computed for all the three lifts: <strong>dip</strong>, <strong>pull-up</strong>, and <strong>squat</strong>. For each lift, we propose two formulas, one corresponding to the predicted <strong>performance of an average participant</strong> (still a good goal for most people) and one corresponding to the predicted <strong>performance of an average <em>above average</em> participant</strong>.</p>

<p>To determine what it means to be above average, we computed the total weight lifted by each participant (dip + pull-up + squat) and then divided it by the weight of participant:</p>

\[\text{score} = \frac{\text{dip} + \text{squat} + \text{pull-up}}{\text{bodyweight}}.\]

<p>This <strong>score</strong> is related to the <strong>relative strength</strong> of the participants and allows us to compare participants across weight classes. We then ranked the participants using this score. The <em>above average</em> participants are the top 50% of the chart according to this score.</p>

<p>In the following graphs, the <strong>color of the points</strong> is related to this <strong>score</strong>: the bluer, the smaller the score, the redder, the higher the score. The <strong>size and transparency of the points</strong> are related to the <strong>height</strong> of the athletes: the bigger and darker, the taller.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-me">What about me?</h2>

<p><strong>Thanks to this competition and this analysis, I have clear goals</strong> that I can aim at during the next few months, maybe years.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> Regression lines are useful to compute predictions and extrapolate from the data. However, it is sometimes more interesting to use a subset of the data to compute more <em>personalized</em> quantities. The drawback is that since less data are used, the uncertainty of computed quantities is theoretically larger. In practice, it can give more precise predictions because we are generalizing from points that are more similar.</p>

<p>I started my calisthenics journey in November 2021, it is therefore expected that my weight is still changing and that I will probably gain some muscle mass in the next months. I therefore somehow makes more sense to first compute a target weight from my height and then compute the associated target lifts. Easy enough with all the data!</p>

<p><strong>I am 1.8 m.</strong> From the collected data, the subset of athletes with this height have the following average numbers (OG: Overcoming Gravity):</p>

<p>Those are quite <strong>challenging goals</strong> for me to have - but what’s the point of a goal if it is not challenging for a bit!</p>

<p>However, those goals are definitely not one year goals.<br />
Nonetheless, let’s see how close I can get!</p>

<p><strong>Let’s meet on this blog in a year to check my results!</strong></p>

We also show how to use these data to set calisthenics goals.</strong></p>

<p>We hope this analysis will help the interested practitioner in their calisthenics journey, as it will <strong>set baselines</strong> that he or she can compare against.</p>

<p>While we intend to help calisthenics practitioners train in an efficient and effective way by making available some useful numbers, <strong>data analysis comes with a good share of caution</strong>.</p>

<p>First, the context: data from which the analysis is built upon come from a weighted calisthenics competition. Second, for all computed average values, the reader must always keep in mind that some <strong>standard deviation</strong><d-footnote>Standard deviation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation</a></d-footnote> <strong>around the mean is expected</strong>. Predictions computed from the data, such as <strong>“given your height, what is your expected weight, were you as performant as the average participant?”</strong>, could be used as a first approximation of a target weight while keeping in mind your unique body features.</p>

<p>The forthcoming numbers should be taken in context and will never be a replacement for a (as) complete (as possible) understanding of the needs of the calisthenics practitioner.</p>

<p>Shall we not be deluded by sheer and raw numbers, we can certainly make good use of them!</p>

<p>I will use the data to show that <strong>I am roughly halfway from being average ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="weighted-calisthenics">Weighted calisthenics</h2>

<p>In 2022 was held the season 1 of the <strong><a href="https://www.kingofweighted-showdown.com/">King of Weighted Calisthenics</a></strong> competition, an international and internet based event organized by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaSchulz">Micha Schulz</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each participant had to <em>get their <strong>weighted</strong> equipment and record their 1RM<d-footnote>One-repetition maximum: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum</a></d-footnote> attempts for <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dip_(exercise)">dips</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_(exercise)">pull-ups</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squat_(exercise)">squats</a></strong> according to some specified rules</em> (especially regarding the range of motion).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly to gymnastics, rock climbing and other bodyweight related sports, <strong>calisthenics</strong> emphasizes on the <strong>strength to bodyweight ratio</strong> and tends to fade in the performances of the best athletes across different weight classes.
However, in <strong>weighted calisthenics</strong>, ones has to lift the additional weight that is attached to one’s body. On one hand, tt seems like the heavier the athlete, the heavier the 1RM additional weight: the <strong>absolute strength</strong> increases with the athlete’s bodyweight. On the other hand, can we say the same thing about the <strong>relative strength</strong>? How does the <strong>added percentage of athlete’s bodyweight</strong> increase with the athlete’s bodyweight?</p>

<p>Let’s find out by analyzing the data!</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The data</h2>

<p>The first step is to <strong>gather and organize the data</strong> in a table and <strong>check for incoherent values</strong>. Because the competition is international, organizers have to take into account both the imperial and metric system. The <strong>metric system is used</strong>: heights are measured in meters and weights in kilograms.</p>

<p>Let’s get a glimpse of the raw data before making them more useful and meaningful.</p>

<p>In the table, one can see that some weights have a residual .1 kg or .7 kg. It seems like a result of the conversion from the imperial system to the metric system. Therefore, one can see that athlete number 144 is likely an american one. Even in an anonymized database, one must be careful about private information that can be extracted from it!</p>

<p><strong>An athletic human being indeed!</strong></p>

<p>Please be aware that, while very few female athletes, there are both male and females athletes in the dataset. Despite our dataset being built only on the participants (thus biased toward their specific characteristics), we can remark that world average male height is 1.77 m, comparable to our computed 1.76 m.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the difference may be explained by the fact that we only considered calisthenics athletes, or by the fact that our dataset included female athletes, but this magnitude falls within the statistical uncertainty of our sample size (of order 0.01 m, i.e. 1 cm). Therefore, we cannot really comment on this difference in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>We hope this small example will help the reader to keep exercising statistical caution while going through the rest of this post.</p>

<p>While averages are interesting, histograms may be more informative.</p>

<p>What does the <strong>height distribution</strong> look like?</p>

<p>Looking at the weight distribution of the athletes, one can spot something that is a bit odd: two major discontinuities at 73 kg and 83 kg. This is the effect of the competition rules! Indeed, there were three weight classes, strictly less than 73 kg (&lt; 73), between 73 kg and 83 kg (73 - 83), and strictly more than 83 kg (&gt; 83). This rule really shows in the weight distribution, in particular close to the 73 kg threshold.</p>

<p>It seems that many athletes tried really hard to get below the 73 kg threshold. Therefore, perhaps to the contrary of what some athletes initially thought, on may imagine that the competition must have been fierce in the less than 73 kg category. Analyzing the data, one can see that athletes between 72 kg and 73 kg are on average as strong (absolute strength) as the average lifter in the 73-83 category. An anomaly<d-footnote>Anomaly Detection: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection</a></d-footnote> regarding the forthcoming graphics and thus a proof of the fierce competition in this category.</p>

<p>However, seeing how the best athletes in the 73-83 categories have been able to lift a heavier total than the best &lt; 73 athlete, it certainly has been a good decision for athletes close to the 73 kg threshold.</p>

<p>Other <strong>strategic statements</strong> might be analyzed from the data, but this is a topic for another post.</p>

<p>The regression line shows that <strong>on average, the athlete’s bodyweight increases of 1 kg per 1 cm of height</strong>. Of course, this is the result of a regression and the graph clearly shows the diversity of profiles, even at the same height, and a significant deviation around the mean.</p>

<p><strong>On average, the taller the calisthenics athlete, the heavier.</strong> This was expected but it is still nice to confirm it with data and back up our knowledge.</p>

<p>The regression line allows us to compute, given the height of a calisthenics practitioner, its expected competitive bodyweight. This can constitute a first approximation of a fitness objective, but the practitioner should keep in mind the deviation around this expectation and that the dataset is built with athletes participating to a competition.</p>

<p>For me, whose height is 1.8 m, a reasonable weight computed from those data could therefore be around 81 kg. I am currently weighting 72 kg, therefore below this landmark. However, I find this computed value a little bit high, especially compared to my other fitness objectives. At the end of this post, I will analyze some features of the athletes having a height of 1.8 m. In particular, we will see that the 1.8 m group has an average weight of 78 kg, which is, as far as I am concerned, a better target value. It seems to me that the computed regression line tends to overestimate the predicted weight. This is may be due to outliers like this one participant whose weight is 112 kg and whose height is 1.77 m.</p>

    Average performances of athletes computed by competitive weight class
</div>

<p><em><strong>Remark:</strong> The total number of athletes, 70+45+33 = 148, is less than the 150 registered because we discarded two incoherent profiles. One of the discarded athlete was registered as 1 meter tall and the other as 5 meter tall.</em></p>

<p>It can be remarked that there are significantly <strong>more athletes in the &lt; 73 kg category</strong>. For the next competition, I will kindly suggest to try to enforce more balanced weight classes. I do think that this would make the competition a bit fairer. I propose two solutions.</p>

<p>Another weight class can be created to make things a bit more even between the athletes of different categories. For instance, if the &lt; 73 kg category were split into a &lt; 70 kg and a 70-73 kg category, the first new one would have 38 participants and the second new one 32.</p>

<p>Of course, I understand that making three categories may be more appealing and that too small categories can create a lack of competition. Based on the current data, it would have been possible (<em>a posteriori</em>) to create the following three balanced weight classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt; 72 kg with 50 participants</li>
  <li>72 - 81 kg with 49 participants</li>
  <li>&gt; 81 kg with 49 participants</li>
</ul>

<p>These two propositions can be merged together in effort to create four <em>as-balanced-as-possible</em> categories. It is interesting to note that other information can be used to set a criterion that define a <strong>fair weight division</strong>. For instance, one could want for the standard deviation of the weights within a weight class to be roughly the same in each class.</p>

<p>From an organizer standpoint, it is worth <strong>investigating the ways to create a fair weight division</strong> while taking into account that a participant may adapt their weight to the announced weight division.
An <strong>unrealistic mathematician solution</strong> would be to announce the weight division after the participants registered.</p>

<p>Back to the analysis of the original weight division, one can visualize the previous table in the form of a radar chart<d-footnote>Radar chart: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart</a></d-footnote> on which one can observe some interesting features.</p>

<h2 id="absolute-strength">Absolute strength</h2>

<p>The <strong>absolute strength</strong> refers to the the <strong>total amount of weight</strong> an athlete can lift, regardless of the athlete’s bodyweight.</p>

<p>Here we investigate, for each exercise, the relation between the added weight and the athlete’s bodyweight: <strong>Does the absolute strength increase with the athlete bodyweight?</strong></p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, we find out that, indeed it does, thus justifying the fairness of implementing weight classes in the competition’s rules.</p>

    Added weight in the <b>dip</b> exercise as a function of the athlete bodyweight

<p>The <strong>regression line</strong> (in red on the graph) shows that the athlete can roughly <strong>add 1.19 kg of additional weight per additional bodyweight kg</strong> to its 1RM. Of course, this is the result of a regression and the graph clearly shows the diversity of profiles, even at the same weight, as well as a significant deviation around the mean.</p>

<p>This graph and regression line also show that, <strong>on average, the heavier the athlete’s bodyweight, the heavier the athlete’s lift</strong>. This was expected but it is still nice to confirm it with data and back up our knowledge.</p>

<p>The <strong>regression line allows us to compute</strong>, given the bodyweight of a calisthenics practitioner, its <strong>expected 1RM</strong> in the dip exercise. This can constitute a first approximation of a fitness objective, but the practitioner should keep in mind the deviation around this expectation and that the dataset is built with athletes participating to a competition.</p>

<p><strong>For me</strong>, whose weight is 72 kg, a reasonable 1RM computed from those data could therefore be around 75 kg. It has been a few months since I tried weighted dips, but last time I tried, I sent 40 kg.</p>

<h2 id="relative-strength">Relative strength</h2>

<p>The <strong>relative strength</strong> refers to the <strong>additional proportion of bodyweight</strong> an athlete can lift. It relates the amount of strength an athlete has compared to his or her bodyweight. As a last topic of investigation, we will try to answer this interesting question:</p>

<p><strong>How does the relative strength depends on the athlete’s bodyweight?</strong></p>

<p>In nature, insects have insane relative strength, children are quite strong, but how strong is the calisthenics adult?</p>

<p>I will link the results of this section with the <strong>level system</strong> that is introduced in the <a href="https://stevenlow.org/overcoming-gravity/"><strong>Overcoming Gravity</strong></a> book written by Steven Low.

    Proportion of added weight in the <b>pull-up</b> exercise as a function of the athlete bodyweight

<p>On average, <strong>for the pull-up exercise a participant can add 74 % of its bodyweight</strong>, an impressive number. That is to say, a good calisthenics athlete is slightly below the <strong>level 8</strong> of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19l4tVfdTJLheLMwZBYqcw1oeEBPRh8mxngqrCz2YnVg/edit#gid=2032740838">progression chart</a> of the <a href="https://stevenlow.org/overcoming-gravity/">Overcoming Gravity</a> book.</p>

<p>This is one good level below the two previous pushing exercises. It is interesting because it means one of the two things: the scale of the Overcoming Gravity book is slightly off, or the athletes are slightly lacking in the <em>relative</em> pulling strength. The two hypothesis are possible because Overcoming Gravity readers and the weighted calisthenics community are focusing on slightly different goals.</p>

<p>From the graph, it seems like, for this pulling exercise, <strong>the lighter the athlete, the slightly better the relative strength</strong>. The regression line indicates a loss of 0.2 % bodyweight strength per kg of bodyweight: For each additional kg of bodyweight, an average (good) athlete can lift 0.2 % less of its own bodyweight.</p>

<p>This wrap up our statistical analysis of the data from the <strong><a href="https://www.kingofweighted-showdown.com/">King of Weighted Calisthenics</a></strong> competition.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-me">What about me?</h2>

<p>From what we computed above, one can see that from a weighted calisthenics standpoint, <strong>I am roughly half-average</strong>. However, considering that I truly started my calisthenics journey one year ago, I am happy that I progressed this far and I am thankful that I am still progressing. <strong>Thanks to this competition and this analysis, I have clear goals</strong> that I can aim at during the next few months, maybe years.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> Regression lines are useful to compute predictions and extrapolate from the data. However, it is sometimes more interesting to use a subset of the data to compute more <em>personalized</em> quantities. The drawback is that since less data are used, the uncertainty of computed quantities is theoretically larger. In practice, it can give more precise predictions because we are generalizing from points that are more similar.</p>

<p><strong>I am 1.8 m.</strong> From the collected data, the subset of athletes with this height have the following average numbers (OG: Overcoming Gravity):</p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>bodyweight</th>
      <th>dip</th>

<p>Those are quite <strong>challenging goals</strong> for me to have - but what’s the point of a goal if it is not challenging for a bit!</p>

<p>It also show that the Overcoming Gravity scale is quite a good and interesting one. Indeed, level 9-10 is the transition from intermediate to advanced athlete according to the book. It is reasonable to think that the average participant of the King of Weighted calisthenics competition is on the verge of being an advanced athlete and that the top percents can be considered closed to (if not) elite athletes.</p>

<p>It is interesting to <strong>compare the above values to the previously computed one</strong> (from the regression). We report the previously computed values below for ease of comparison.</p>

<p>That is say, considering only the relevant subset of participants, <strong>my new target weight is lighter but my target lifts are heavier…</strong></p>

<p><strong>Wonderful!</strong></p>

<p>What I prefer about the numbers computed from the subset of athletes that are 1.8 meter tall is that they correspond to <strong>a greater relative strength</strong>.</p>
